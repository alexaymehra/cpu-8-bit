# 8-bit CPU
Complete 8-bit CPU with simple ISA. Von Neumann Architecture.

## Toolchain:
- **Editor:** Visual Studio Code
- **Simulation:** Icarus Verilog 12.0
- **Platform:** Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2)

## About
If the memory address that is decoded reads 0xFF then the CPU finishes running. 

## Todo
- Make the CPU stop if the final memory address is reached.
- Fix timing and control issues.
- Add extra clarity to code.
